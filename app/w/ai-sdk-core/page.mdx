# Using AI Vercel SDK (AI SDK Core) with Next.js and App Router

<Name />

In this article, we will be going through how to setup the AI Vercel SDK with App Router and the Stream Chat Completion Function. With this, there will be no in depth explanation and only a step by step guide

![Next.js and App Router](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*__whRhzo_xysSEqwtNPezA.png)

## Setting Up the Development Environment

If you already know how to this part then you can skip to the integration of the AI SDK. Also, make sure to have Node Package Manager installed on your device if you haven't already.

1. Create Next.js Project

```bash
bun create next-app

- What is your project named? <insert_folder_name_here>
- Would you like to use TypeScript? Yes
- Would you like to use ESLint? Yes
- Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes
- Would you like to use `src/` directory? No
- Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) Yes
- Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No

```

Don't worry to much about **bun**, you can use npm, yarn, or pnpm.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
or
yarn create-next-app-ts
or
pnpm create next-app
```

2. Install additional dependencies

```bash
bun add ai @ai-sdk/openai react-markdown
```

You can use any provider here such as Google or AWS Bedrock like so

```bash
bun add @ai-sdk/google or @ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock
```

To see more available providers click on the link below:

[AI SDK Providers](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers?source=post_page-----fa2ed150328a--------------------------------)

(Optional)
The styling being used here will be Shadcn, you don't necessarily need to use this but it'll be faster to speed up the process.

```bash
bunx shadcn@latest init

- Which style would you like to use? Default
- WHich color would you like to use as the base color? Neutral
- Would you like to use CSS Variables for theming? yes

bunx shadcn@latest add button input
```

3. Create an environment variable file

Create a new file called _.env.local_ in the root directory and this is where you'll store various API Keys. As said before, you can use any provider but for this project, we will be using Google as this is the free option.

```bash
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
```

4. Creating Server Action

We will be implementing a _continueConversation_ function that will insert the user's message into the conversation and stream back the new message.

Create a new file _app/actions.tsx_ and add the following:

```ts
'use server'
import { createStreamableValue} from "ai/rsc"
import { CoreMessage, streamText } from "ai"
import { google } from "@ai-sdk/google"

const systemPrompt = '' // you can add your prompt here for a better responsive AI

export async function continueConversation() {
  model: google('gemini-1.5-pro-latest'),
  system: systemPrompt,
  messages,

  const stream = createStreamableValue(result.textStream)
  return stream.value;
}
```

Yep, it's that simple!

5. Creating the Chatbot Component

Create a new Folder called _components_ if you don't have one already and create a new file called _components/chatbot.tsx_ and add the following. Don't worry, we'll be calling this component in _app/page.tsx_ later on.

```tsx
"use client";

import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import { CoreMessage } from "ai";
import { continueConversation } from "@/app/actions";
import { readStreamableValue } from "ai/rsc";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import ReactMarkdown from "react-markdown";
import { Send } from "lucide-react";

interface ChatbotProps {
  e: React.FormEvent;
  messages: CoreMessage[];
  setMessages: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<CoreMessage[]>>;
  input: string;
  setInput: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<string>>;
}

async function handleSendMessage({
  e,
  messages,
  setMessages,
  input,
  setInput,
}: ChatbotProps) {
  e.preventDefault();

  const newMessages: CoreMessage[] = [
    ...messages,
    {
      role: "user",
      content: input,
    },
  ];

  setMessages(newMessages);
  setInput("");

  const result = await continueConversation(newMessages);

  for await (const content of readStreamableValue(result)) {
    setMessages([
      ...newMessages,
      {
        role: "assistant",
        content: content as string,
      },
    ]);
  }
}

export function ChatbotUI() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<CoreMessage[]>([]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState<string>("");
  const messagesEndRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);

  const scrollToBottom = () => {
    messagesEndRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth" });
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    scrollToBottom();
  }, [messages]);

  return (
    <div className="mt-10">
      <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto p-4 space-y-4">
        {messages.map((message, index) => (
          <div key={index}>
            <div className="">
              {message.role}:{" "}
              <ReactMarkdown>{`${String(message.content)}`}</ReactMarkdown>
            </div>
          </div>
        ))}
        <div ref={messagesEndRef} />
      </div>
      <div className="">
        <form
          onSubmit={(e) =>
            handleSendMessage({ e, messages, setMessages, input, setInput })
          }
          className="flex items-center gap-2"
        >
          <div className="relative max-h-60 flex flex-row w-full grow justify-between overflow-hidden bg-zinc-100 dark:bg-slate-800 px-6 rounded-full border focus:outline-1">
            <input
              id="message"
              placeholder="Type your message here..."
              className="max-h-[60px] flex-1 border-none focus-within:outline-none bg-transparent"
              autoComplete="off"
              value={input}
              onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
            />
            <Button
              type="submit"
              variant="ghost"
              size="icon"
              className="rounded-full hover:bg-muted"
            >
              <Send className="w-4 h-4" />
            </Button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now let's navigate to _app/page.tsx_

```tsx
import { ChatbotUI } from "@/components/chatbot";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="">
      <ChatbotUI />
    </div>
  );
}
```

6. Test the Application

Once you added your own styling and everything is setup properly, let's start up the development server.

```bash
bun run dev
```

and navigate to _http://localhost:3000_

# Conclusion

And yeahhhh, if everything goes well then you are now able to create or integrate AI into your web applications. Feel free to hit me up if anything goes wrong and I will try my best to either help you out or edit this blog for any updates made by the developers at Vercel.
